1) Language and Tools: Developed in C programming language, leveraging standard input/output functions and file handling for data storage.
2) Structures Used:
  > Vehicle Structure: Stores details like vehicle number, type, owner's name, and entry/exit timestamps.
  > Parking Structure: Holds vehicle number, type, parking duration in hours, and calculated charges.
3) Functionalities:
  > Data Input: Allows input of vehicle details including number, type (Car, Bike, Truck, Other), owner's name, entry and exit timestamps.
  > Calculation: Computes parking duration in hours and charges based on vehicle type using predefined rates.
  > File Handling: Saves vehicle details and parking records to text files (vehicledetails.txt and parkingrecords.txt) for persistent storage.
  > Data Retrieval: Offers options to retrieve and display vehicle details or parking information interactively.
  > User Interface: Uses console prompts and menus for user interaction, facilitating easy data retrieval and management.
  > Purpose: Facilitates efficient management of parking services, providing administrators with tools to track and manage vehicle entries, calculate parking charges, and maintain accurate records.

--> This Project Enhances operational efficiency and customer service in parking management through systematic data handling and user-friendly interface.
